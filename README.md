# git-remote-s3

## About this fork

This is a fork of [awslabs/git-remote-s3](https://github.com/awslabs/git-remote-s3), licensed under the
Apache License 2.0 (unchanged). Notable additions in this fork:

- Fix for LFS temp-file paths when the repo is used as a submodule
- Per-remote LFS scoping, so a repo can mix an S3 LFS remote with non-S3 remotes
- Auto-install of the LFS transfer agent on first remote-helper run, scoped per remote (never the repo-wide `lfs.standalonetransferagent`)
- Pushes no longer stall ~10s per push on git-lfs's pure-SSH endpoint probe of the `s3://` URL — the auto-install writes `remote.<name>.lfsurl`, which suppresses it
- DNS TXT bucket-alias resolution for `s3://` remote URIs
- S3 Access Grants support, region-aware S3 clients, and a `git-s3 doctor` diagnostic command
- Doctor repairs are safe for nested remote prefixes (e.g. `s3://bucket/team/repo`): keys are parsed relative to the repo prefix, and the LFS object store is never mistaken for a branch
- Pushing from a shallow clone is rejected with a clear error telling you to run `git fetch --unshallow` first, instead of silently uploading a truncated bundle
- Partial clones (`git clone --filter=blob:none` / `--filter=tree:0`) are fully supported for push and fetch
- Push and fetch render live transfer progress on the terminal, honoring `git push --quiet` / `--progress`
- `--force-with-lease` is supported with real compare-and-swap semantics against the remote ref, not just a `+` force push

This fork is published on PyPI as `fduplex-git-remote-s3`, but it installs the same `git-remote-s3`
command as upstream and therefore replaces it, so a given environment should install
`fduplex-git-remote-s3` or upstream `git-remote-s3`, not both.

This library enables to use Amazon S3 as a git remote and LFS server.

It provides an implementation of a [git remote helper](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitremote-helpers) to use S3 as a serverless Git server.

It also provide an implementation of the [git-lfs custom transfer](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/docs/custom-transfers.md) to enable pushing LFS managed files to the same S3 bucket used as remote.

## Installation

`git-remote-s3` is a Python script and works with any Python version >= 3.9.

Run:

```
pip install fduplex-git-remote-s3
```

## Prerequisites

Before you can use `git-remote-s3`, you must:

- Complete initial configuration:

  - Creating an AWS account
  - Configuring an IAM user or role

- Create an AWS S3 bucket (or have one already) in your AWS account.
- Attach a minimal policy to that user/role that allows the to the S3 bucket:

  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Sid": "S3ObjectAccess",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": ["s3:PutObject", "s3:GetObject", "s3:DeleteObject", "s3:AbortMultipartUpload"],
        "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::<BUCKET>/*"]
      },
      {
        "Sid": "S3ListAccess",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": ["s3:ListBucket"],
        "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::<BUCKET>"]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

- Optional (but recommended) - use [SSE-KMS Bucket keys to encrypt the content of the bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucket-key.html), ensure the user/role create previously has the permission to access and use the key.

```json
{
  "Sid": "KMSAccess",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": ["kms:Decrypt", "kms:GenerateDataKey"],
  "Resource": ["arn:aws:kms:<REGION>:<ACCOUNT>:key/<KEY_ID>"]
}
```

- Install Python and its package manager, pip, if they are not already installed. To download and install the latest version of Python, [visit the Python website](https://www.python.org/).
- Install Git on your Linux, macOS, Windows, or Unix computer.
- Install the latest version of the AWS CLI on your Linux, macOS, Windows, or Unix computer. You can find instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html).

## Security

### Data encryption

All data is encrypted at rest and in transit by default. To add an additional layer of security you can use customer managed KMS keys to encrypt the data at rest on the S3 bucket. We recommend to use [Bucket keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucket-key.html) to minimize the KMS costs.

### Access control

Access control to the remote is ensured via IAM permissions, and can be controlled at:

- bucket level
- prefix level (you can use prefixes to store multiple repos in the same S3 bucket thus minimizing the setup effort)
- KMS key level

If you store multiple repos in a single bucket but would like to separate permissions to access each repo, you can do so by modifying the resource definitions for the object related action to specify the repo prefix and by adding a condition to the ListBucket action to restrict the operation to matching prefixes (and by consequence the corresponding repo) :

```json
      {
        "Sid": "S3ObjectAccess",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
          "s3:PutObject",
          "s3:GetObject",
          "s3:DeleteObject",
          "s3:AbortMultipartUpload"
        ],
        "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::<BUCKET>/<REPO>/*"]
      },
      {
        "Sid": "S3ListObjects",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
          "s3:ListBucket",
        ],
        "Condition": {
          "StringEquals": {
            "s3:prefix": "<REPO>"
          }
        },
        "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::<BUCKET>"]
      },
```

Using the condition key restricts the access operation to the content of the specific repo in the bucket.

## Use S3 remotes

### Create a new repo

S3 remotes are identified by the prefix `s3://` and at the bare minimum specify the name of the bucket. You can also provide a key prefix as in `s3://my-git-bucket/my-repo` and a profile `s3://my-profile@my-git-bucket/myrepo`.

```bash
mkdir my-repo
cd my-repo
git init
git remote add origin s3://my-git-bucket/my-repo
```

You can then add a file, commit and push the changes to the remote:

```bash
echo "Hello" > hello.txt
git add -A
git commit -a -m "hello"
git push --set-upstream origin main
```

The remote HEAD is set to track the branch that has been pushed first to the remote repo. To change the remote HEAD branch, delete the HEAD object `s3://<bucket>/<prefix>/HEAD` and then run `git-remote-s3 doctor s3://<bucket>/<prefix>`.

When you use `s3+zip://` instead of `s3://`, an additional zip archive named `repo.zip` is uploaded next to the `sha.bundle` file. This is for example useful if you want to use the Repo as a S3 Source for AWS CodePipeline, which expects a `.zip` file. The path on S3 when you push to the `main` branch is for example `refs/heads/main/repo.zip`. See [How S3 remote work](#how-s3-remote-work) for more details about the bundle file.

The `s3+zip://` transport is still fully supported. However, because PyPI does not permit the `+` character in an
installed command name, the `git-remote-s3+zip` helper is no longer installed automatically. If you use `s3+zip://`
remotes, create the helper once as an alias of the `s3` helper, e.g.
`ln -s "$(command -v git-remote-s3)" ~/.local/bin/git-remote-s3+zip` (or copy it to a directory on your `PATH` on
Windows).

### Clone a repo

To clone the repo to another folder just use the normal git syntax using the s3 URI as remote:

```bash
git clone s3://my-git-bucket/my-repo my-repo-clone
```

### DNS bucket aliases

> **Fork addition** (not in upstream awslabs/git-remote-s3): the bucket component of the remote URI can be a DNS hostname aliasing the real bucket.

When the bucket component of the remote URI contains at least one dot, it is treated as a DNS hostname instead of a literal bucket name (bucket names used with this feature must not contain dots). The hostname is resolved to the real bucket name via a DNS TXT lookup using the system resolver, so split-horizon/VPN DNS setups work as usual:

- A TXT record must exist at the alias hostname itself.
- Among its TXT values, exactly one must have the form `git-bucket=<real-bucket-name>`; other TXT values at the same name are ignored.

For example, with the record

```
repos.git.example.com. 300 IN TXT "git-bucket=my-git-bucket-123456789012-us-east-2"
```

the following commands are equivalent:

```bash
git clone s3://repos.git.example.com/my-repo
git clone s3://my-git-bucket-123456789012-us-east-2/my-repo
```

Aliases work in every place a remote URI is accepted: the git remote helper, the `git-lfs-s3` transfer agent and `git-lfs-s3 install --remote`, and the `git-s3` management CLI. Resolution results are cached for the lifetime of the process. If the alias has no TXT record or no `git-bucket=` value, the command fails with an error describing the expected record instead of falling back to using the hostname as a bucket name.

Alias resolution is enabled by default and can be disabled via git config, so a dotted bucket component is treated as a literal bucket name again:

```bash
# per remote (takes precedence when set):
git config remote.origin.s3-dns-alias false
# for all remotes (used when the per-remote key is unset or no remote name is known):
git config s3.dns-alias false
```

Both keys are booleans; setting the per-remote key to `true` re-enables aliasing for that remote even when `s3.dns-alias` is `false`. The per-remote key applies where a remote name is available (the git remote helper, the LFS transfer agent, `git-lfs-s3 install --remote`); the `git-s3` CLI takes a URI rather than a remote name and honors only `s3.dns-alias`.

### Bucket region cache

> **Fork addition** (not in upstream awslabs/git-remote-s3): the bucket's region is detected once and remembered in the repo's local git config.

Every S3 client the remote helper builds is pinned to the bucket's own region, which otherwise costs a `HeadBucket` round trip on every single git command. The first successful detection is written to the repo-local git config as `remote.<name>.s3region`, and every later invocation reads it from there instead:

```bash
git config --get remote.origin.s3region
# eu-west-1
```

The value is written on the first clone, fetch or push against a remote, and only for a real remote name — a push straight to a URI (`git push s3://bucket/repo ...`) detects the region and does not cache it. For submodules the key lands in the submodule's own config under `.git/modules/<name>/config`.

If a bucket ever moves to another region, the cached value goes stale. The helper notices the redirect S3 returns, drops the key and retries once, so the operation still succeeds; you can also clear it by hand:

```bash
git config --unset remote.origin.s3region
```

### S3 Access Grants

> **Fork addition** (not in upstream awslabs/git-remote-s3): the [AWS S3 Access Grants boto3 plugin](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-s3-access-grants-plugin-boto3) is bundled and auto-registered on every S3 client this tool builds — the git remote helper, the `git-lfs-s3` transfer agent, and the `git-s3` management CLI.

Registration is transparent and always runs with fallback enabled, so a single code path serves both credential models:

- A caller whose identity holds an S3 Access Grant gets short-lived, prefix-scoped credentials vended by Access Grants for each S3 operation.
- A caller using plain IAM credentials (an access-key user or a role with direct S3 policy access and no grant) transparently falls back to a direct S3 call — no configuration needed.

On the first fallback in a process a one-time notice is printed to stderr; it points you at `git-s3 doctor` (below) if you *expected* Access Grants to be used.

#### IAM permissions for the Access Grants path

To use Access Grants, the caller role/identity needs **both** of these actions on the Access Grants instance resource:

- `s3:GetDataAccess` — vends the scoped credentials.
- `s3:GetAccessGrantsInstanceForPrefix` — resolves which account owns the Access Grants instance for the requested `s3://bucket/prefix`.

The plugin calls `GetAccessGrantsInstanceForPrefix` **before** it can call `GetDataAccess`, because it must first learn the owner account id to target. This is a separate IAM action that is easy to overlook: if the caller has `s3:GetDataAccess` but not `s3:GetAccessGrantsInstanceForPrefix`, the plugin fails during that preflight and — because fallback is enabled — **silently** drops to direct S3 credentials. The user then sees only a misleading downstream `AccessDenied` from the direct call (or a successful direct call that never used Access Grants at all), with nothing pointing at the real cause. Grant both actions together.

#### Diagnosing with `git-s3 doctor`

`git-s3 doctor <remote>` runs an Access Grants entitlement check as its own section. Unlike the normal path, this check runs the plugin with fallback **disabled** and drives the full vend path (including the `GetAccessGrantsInstanceForPrefix` preflight) against the repo's prefix, so it surfaces the real error the fallback would otherwise hide. It reports:

- `Access Grants: OK` when credentials were vended for the repo prefix.
- `Access Grants: not available (using direct S3 credentials)` on an `AccessDenied`, naming the exact failing operation and the missing permission — e.g. `caller role is missing s3:GetAccessGrantsInstanceForPrefix` or `caller role is missing s3:GetDataAccess or has no matching grant`.

This is informational: an IAM-key user with no grant legitimately reports "not available" and keeps working via direct credentials — that is expected, not an error.

#### Bucket region auto-detection

The S3 client is automatically pinned to the bucket's real region, detected via a `HeadBucket` probe (which returns the region even for an unauthorized caller, so it needs no extra permission and is cached per process). You do **not** need your default region to match the bucket's region; if the region cannot be determined the tool proceeds with your default region and S3's cross-region redirects, exactly as before.

### Branches, etc.

Creating branches and pushing them works as normal:

```bash
cd my-repo
git checkout -b new_branch
touch new_file.txt
git add -A
git commit -a -m "new file"
git push origin new_branch
```

All git operations that do not rely on communication with the server should work as usual (eg `git merge`)

### Using S3 remotes for submodules

If you have a repo that uses submodules also hosted on S3, you need to run the following command:

```
git config protocol.s3.allow always
```

Or, to enable globally:

```
git config --global protocol.s3.allow always
```

## Repo as S3 Source for AWS CodePipeline

[AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/) offers an [Amazon S3 source action](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/integrations-action-type.html#integrations-source-s3)
as location for your source code and application files. But this requires to `upload the source files as a single ZIP file`.
As briefly mentioned in [Create a new repo](#create-a-new-repo), `git-remote-s3` can create and upload zip archives.
When you use `s3+zip` as URI Scheme when you add the remote, `git-remote-s3` will automatically upload an archive that can be used by AWS CodePipeline.

### Archive file location

Let's assume your bucket name is `my-git-bucket` and the repo is called `my-repo`. Run `git remote add origin s3+zip://my-git-bucket/my-repo` to use it as remote.
When you now commit your changes and push to the remote, an additional `repo.zip` file will be uploaded to the bucket.
For example, if you push to the `main` branch (`git push origin main`), the file is available under `s3://my-git-bucket/my-repo/refs/heads/main/repo.zip`.
When you push to a branch called `fix_a_bug` it's available under `s3://my-git-bucket/my-repo/refs/heads/fix_a_bug/repo.zip`.
And if you create and push a tag called `v1.0` it will be `s3://my-git-bucket/my-repo/refs/tags/v1.0/repo.zip`.

### Example AWS CodePipeline source action config

Your AWS CodePipeline Action configuration to trigger when you update your `main` branch:

- Action Provider: `Amazon S3`
- Bucket: `my-git-bucket`
- S3 object key: `my-repo/refs/heads/main/repo.zip`
- Change detection options: `AWS CodePipeline`

Visit [Tutorial: Create a simple pipeline (S3 bucket)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/tutorials-simple-s3.html) to learn more about a S3 bucket as source action.

## LFS

To use LFS you need to first install git-lfs. You can refer to the [official documentation](https://git-lfs.com/) on how to do this on your system.

Next, enable the S3 integration in the repo. There are two install modes:

```bash
# Per-remote (recommended; required when other LFS remotes coexist)
git-lfs-s3 install --remote <remote-name>

# Unscoped (back-compat; applies the agent to ALL remotes in the repo)
git-lfs-s3 install
```

`--remote` writes a per-remote scoped configuration so `git-lfs-s3` only fires for that one remote — letting an S3 remote coexist with non-S3 LFS remotes (e.g. GitHub, GitLab) without breaking their LFS push/pull. Use it whenever the repo has more than one remote.

The bare `git-lfs-s3 install` form sets `lfs.standalonetransferagent` globally and is short for:

```bash
git config --add lfs.customtransfer.git-lfs-s3.path git-lfs-s3
git config --add lfs.standalonetransferagent git-lfs-s3
```

`git-lfs-s3 install --remote <name>` instead writes:

```bash
git config remote.<name>.lfsurl https://lfs-alias.git-remote-s3.test/<bucket>/<prefix>
git config lfs.<that-url>.standalonetransferagent git-lfs-s3
git config lfs.customtransfer.git-lfs-s3.path git-lfs-s3
```

The `lfs-alias.git-remote-s3.test` host is a synthetic, never-contacted match key (the `.test` TLD is reserved by RFC 6761 for non-resolvable use). It exists only because git-lfs's URL parser does not natively understand `s3://` URLs and would otherwise fall back to SSH-style endpoint discovery; setting `remote.<name>.lfsurl` short-circuits that path and gives the scoped agent lookup a stable URL to match against.

`<bucket>` in that URL is the bucket component of the remote URL verbatim: when the remote uses a DNS bucket alias (e.g. `s3://demos.git.example.com/my-repo`), the alias — not the resolved bucket name — is written into the config, so re-pointing the alias at a different bucket never invalidates existing checkouts. Re-running `git-lfs-s3 install --remote <name>` migrates configs written by older versions that rendered the resolved bucket name.

`lfs.customtransfer.git-lfs-s3.path` is necessarily repo-wide (git-lfs registers transfer adapters globally, not per URL), so `git-lfs-s3` is still listed in the `transfers` array of batch requests sent to other LFS servers. If a server rejects requests naming unknown adapters, set:

```bash
git config lfs.basictransfersonly true
```

which makes git-lfs omit the `transfers` array entirely. This setting is repo-wide and limits other remotes to basic HTTPS transfers; GitHub-style hosts already use these (even over SSH remotes), so only the rare server that speaks exclusively the pure-SSH LFS protocol is affected.

### Fetching through a facade URL (uv and friends)

Some tools invoke git-lfs with a URL instead of a remote name, in a directory that has no remotes configured at all: `uv` does exactly this for a git dependency with `lfs = true`, running `git lfs fetch <url> <sha>` inside its own cache directory. git-lfs passes that URL to the transfer agent verbatim, before any rewriting.

For those callers, map the facade URL to the S3 remote with git's standard URL rewriting:

```bash
git config --global url."s3://<bucket>/<prefix>".insteadOf https://git.example.com/<prefix>
git config --global lfs.customtransfer.git-lfs-s3.path git-lfs-s3
git config --global lfs."https://s3".standalonetransferagent git-lfs-s3
```

The agent re-applies the `insteadOf` mapping itself (longest matching prefix wins, same as git) to recover the `s3://` URI, so the fetch works with no remote configured. Without a matching `insteadOf` entry it fails the transfer with an error naming the URL it could not map.

### Creating the repo and pushing

Let's assume we want to store TIFF file in LFS.

```bash
mkdir lfs-repo
cd lfs-repo
git init
git lfs install
git remote add origin s3://my-git-bucket/lfs-repo
git-lfs-s3 install --remote origin
git lfs track "*.tiff"
git add .gitattributes
<put file.tiff in the repo>
git add file.tiff
git commit -a -m "my first tiff file"
git push --set-upstream origin main
```

### Clone the repo

```bash
git clone s3://my-git-bucket/lfs-repo lfs-repo-clone
```

`git-remote-s3` installs the LFS transfer agent in the new repo's local config on first invocation, so `git clone` and `git submodule add` work without extra setup. It writes exactly the same per-remote keys as `git-lfs-s3 install --remote <name>` — `lfs.customtransfer.git-lfs-s3.path`, `remote.<name>.lfsurl` and the URL-scoped `lfs.<url>.standalonetransferagent` — and never the repo-wide `lfs.standalonetransferagent`. Set `GIT_REMOTE_S3_AUTO_INSTALL_LFS=0` to opt out; an existing `lfs.standalonetransferagent` naming another agent, or an existing `remote.<name>.lfsurl`, suppresses the install entirely, and nothing is written for a remote that is not an `s3://` URL.

## Notes about specific behaviors of Amazon S3 remotes

### Arbitrary Amazon S3 URIs

An Amazon S3 URI for a valid bucket and an arbitrary prefix which does not contain the right structure under it, is considered valid.

`git ls-remote` returns an empty list and `git clone` clones an empty repository for which the S3 URI is set as remote origin.

```
% git clone s3://my-git-bucket/this-is-a-new-repo
Cloning into 'this-is-a-new-repo'...
warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.
% cd this-is-a-new-repo
% git remote -v
origin  s3://my-git-bucket/this-is-a-new-repo (fetch)
origin  s3://my-git-bucket/this-is-a-new-repo (push)
```

**Tip**: This behavior can be used to quickly create a new git repo.

`git-remote-s3` implements **per-reference locking** to prevent concurrent write conflicts when multiple clients push to the same branch simultaneously.


When pushing to a remote reference, `git-remote-s3` uses S3 conditional writes to acquire an exclusive lock for that specific reference:

1. **Lock acquisition**: A lock file is created at `<prefix>/<ref>/LOCK#.lock` using S3's `IfNoneMatch="*"` condition, ensuring only one client can acquire the lock at a time
2. **Push execution**: While holding the lock, the client safely uploads the new bundle and cleans up the previous one
3. **Lock release**: The lock is automatically released after the push completes

#### Concurrent push behavior

If multiple clients attempt to push to the same reference simultaneously:

- Only one client will successfully acquire the lock and proceed with the push
- Other clients will receive a clear error message indicating lock acquisition failed
- The failed clients can retry their push after the lock is released

Example error message when lock acquisition fails:

```
error refs/heads/main "failed to acquire ref lock at my-repo/refs/heads/main/LOCK#.lock. 
Another client may be pushing. If this persists beyond 60s, 
run git-remote-s3 doctor --lock-ttl 60 to inspect and optionally clear stale locks."
```

#### Lock timeout and cleanup

- **Lock TTL**: Locks automatically expire after 60 seconds by default (configurable via `GIT_REMOTE_S3_LOCK_TTL_SECONDS` environment variable)
- **Stale lock detection**: If a lock becomes stale (older than the TTL), it can be automatically replaced during lock acquisition
- **Manual cleanup**: Use `git-remote-s3 doctor <s3-uri> --lock-ttl <seconds>` to inspect and optionally clean up stale locks

This locking mechanism eliminates the race conditions that could previously result in multiple bundles per reference, ensuring consistent repository state across concurrent operations.


### Concurrent writes

Due to the distributed nature of `git`, there might be cases (albeit rare) where 2 or more `git push` are executed at the same time by different user with their own modification of the same branch. `git-remote-s3` implements **per-reference locking** to prevent concurrent write conflicts in those cases.

#### Per-reference locking
The git command executes the push in 4 steps:

1. first it checks if the remote reference is the correct ancestor for the commit being pushed
2. if that is correct it invokes the `git-remote-s3` command then attempts acquire a lock by creating the lock object `<prefix>/<ref>/LOCK#.lock` using S3 conditional writes.
3. while holding the lock, `git-remote-s3` safely writes the bundle to the S3 bucket at the `refs/heads/<branch>` path
4. `git-remote-s3` deletes the lock object after the push succeeds, thereby releasing the lock for that ref

Clients that fail to acquire the lock will fail with the following error and can try to push again.

```
error refs/heads/main "failed to acquire ref lock at my-repo/refs/heads/main/LOCK#.lock. 
Another client may be pushing. If this persists beyond 60s, 
run git-remote-s3 doctor --lock-ttl 60 to inspect and optionally clear stale locks."
```

The per-reference locks automatically expire after 60 seconds by default. This TTL is configurable via `GIT_REMOTE_S3_LOCK_TTL_SECONDS` environment variable
If for some reason a reference's lock becomes stale, `git-remote-s3` automatically clears it when executing a git push.
If you repeatedly run into lock acquisition failures or otherwise want to manually clean up stale locks, run `git-remote-s3 doctor <s3-uri> --lock-ttl <seconds>` to inspect and optionally remove those stale locks.

#### Multiple branch heads
In the (rare) case where multiple `git push` commands are simultaneously executed with one or more clients running an outdated version of `git-remote-s3` without locking proection, then it is possible that that multiple bundles will be written to S3 for the same branch head. All subsequent `git push` commands will fail with the following error:

```
error: dst refspec refs/heads/<branch>> matches more than one
error: failed to push some refs to 's3://<bucket>/<prefix>'
```

To fix this issue, run the `git-remote-s3 doctor <s3-uri>` command. By default it will create a new branch for every bundle that should not be retained. The user can then checkout the branch locally and merge it to the original branch. If you want instead to remove the bundle, specify `--delete-bundle`.

## Manage the Amazon S3 remote

### Delete branches

To remove remote branches that are not used anymore you can use the `git-s3 delete-branch <s3uri> -b <branch_name>` command. This command deletes the bundle object(s) from Amazon S3 under the branch path.

### Protected branches

To protect/unprotect a branch run `git s3 protect <remote> <branch-name>` respectively `git s3 unprotect <remote> <branch-name>`.

## Under the hood

### How S3 remote work

Bundles are stored in the S3 bucket as `<prefix>/<ref>/<sha>.bundle`.

When listing remote ref (eg explicitly via `git ls-remote`) we list all the keys present under the given `<prefix>`.

When pushing a new ref (eg a commit), we get the sha of the ref, we bundle the ref via `git bundle create <sha>.bundle <ref>` and store it to S3 according the schema above.

If the push is successful, the code removes the previous bundle associated to the ref.

If two user concurrently push a commit based on the same current branch head to the remote both bundles would be written to the repo and the current bundle removed. No data is lost, but no further push will be possible until all bundles but one are removed.
For this you can use the `git s3 doctor <remote>` command.

### How LFS work

The LFS integration stores the file in the bucket defined by the remote URI, under a key `<prefix>/lfs/<oid>`, where oid is the unique identifier assigned by git-lfs to the file.

If an object with the same key already exists, git-lfs-s3 does not upload it again.

### Debugging

Use `--verbose` flag or set `transfer.verbosity=2` to print debug information when performing git operations:

```bash
git -c transfer.verbosity=2 push origin main
```

For early errors (like credential issues), use the environment variable:

```bash
GIT_REMOTE_S3_VERBOSE=1 git push origin main
```

Logs will be put to stderr.

For LFS operations you can enable and disable debug logging via `git-lfs-s3 enable-debug` and `git-lfs-s3 disable-debug` respectively. Logs are put in `.git/lfs/tmp/git-lfs-s3.log` in the repo.

## Credits

The git S3 integration was inspired by the work of Bryan Gahagan on [git-remote-s3](https://github.com/bgahagan/git-remote-s3).

The LFS implementation benefitted from [lfs-s3](https://github.com/nicolas-graves/lfs-s3) by [@nicolas-graves](https://github.com/nicolas-graves). If you do not need to use the git-remote-s3 transport you should use that project.
